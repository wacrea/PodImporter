What is it ?
============

This is a wordpress plugin. A PHP function which parse iTunes XML podcast feed and store each show as a Wordpress article.

Warning
-------
This is the code as it's working on Freepod.net.
So, you can't copy it as it is on your Wordpress site. If you want to import your podasts as articles, you must change the podcast list in "functions_main.php". And maybe check the category slugs.
